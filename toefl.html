	<p>Welcome to my TOEFL learning page. I will update my recent learning situation here, summarize my experience and urge myself.
  <p>You'd better use the computer version to view this web page.
</p>
	<p>My English is limited and may not be comfortable to read. So you can click on <a href="toefl_CN.html">the Chinese version</a> for a more comfortable reading.

</p>
  <p>Now my exam has finished, I got a relatively satisfactory result in the first exam. Therefore, I will keep a record of my study process for future reference of students who are preparing to take the exam, and upload some materials and links that I think are very useful. I try to keep them as organized as possible.</p>
	<p>Preface: Communication is important in preparing for the TOEFL, and working alone can lead to confusion.

</p>
  <h2>Some learning materials
 </h2>
  <p>I mainly use <a href="https://tpo.xdf.cn/home">TPO</a> (or <a href="https://liuxue.koolearn.com/toefl/tpoModeTest/">the new edition</a>)as the material for practice in the earlier stage. Before the test, I use <a href="https://top.zhan.com/toefl/" >小站托福</a> more, because it can unlock the relatively new TPO.

In addition, there are some materials from various organizations, I don't know if they are useful. Most of them are not put on the homepage due to copyright and other issues. If you need these, you can <a href="index.html">contact me</a> for them.</p>
  <ul>
	<li> 
				<p><a href="reading1.xlsx" title="Reading classification">TPO Reading classification.</a>	The content of the reading is classified and the difficulty is graded. The passages marked as difficult are of high gold content. It is recommended to finish them all before the test. The questions on the test will be a little easier than these, so you'll be comfortable with them.

	  </p>
	</li>
	<li> 
				<p><a href="https://www.hugejiaoyu.com/2021/03/22/2019sptopics/">虎哥教育

</a>				On this website you can find a collection of independent spoken English in recent years. If you practice speaking independently enough, you'll come to the test feeling like you've seen all the questions, including the questions in the actual test.

</p>
				
	</li>
		<li> 
				<p><a href="https://www.toeflresources.com/sample-toefl-essays/" >TOEFL® Resources by Michael Goodine.</a>				I only noticed this website a week before the exam. There are many classic writing samples and templates for reference, covering a wide range of topics and types. In addition, there are also some independent oral templates and counter examples, which are very good. I have not seen the content of listening and reading on the website, so I do not comment on it.</p>
	  </li>
		<li>
		  <p><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UJ411T7oN/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=c5fe1df56a9334dc0913399e9b023074">Independent writing course from Vince.</a> One week before the exam, I started to learn independent writing. I mainly watched the first few videos of this series and memorized the beginning paragraph, and achieved unimaginable results.
</p> 
		</li>
	  <li><p><a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Yvwo8FEUtIxzCQUB7zHQlw">TPO 1-73</a> Password: 6esy. Here you can find almost all the TPO exercises, but because they are pirated, the quality is not high. Serial number on the front of the TPO, you had better use New Oriental or small station to practice. There are also some materials from an unknown language tutoring organization in this file, which I have not seen. Please judge whether it is helpful for you.</p></li>
	  <li><p><a href="materials.rar">Computer test prediction questions and other relevant test preparation materials.</a> It is used to practice independent speaking before the test, and also to write an outline for independent writing questions.

</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>  <img src="cb1.png" width="150"/></p><hr />
<br><p>The following is a record of my preparation process for the first test, except maybe the week before the test. I threw in some experience and gossip when I was sorting through the materials after the exam.

</p>
	<h2>Study plan</h2>
	With the resources at hand, I plan to practice reading at least one piece, listening to one set and speaking 10 recordings every day. I will read some articles about writing. If you have plans to study TOEFL in the near future, or have some valuable suggestions, welcome to communicate with me!
</p>
<p>Below I will put some documents documenting my study. <span data-section="0" data-sentence="0" data-group="0-0">I hope I can update it every day</span>.</p>
<p data-section="0"><span data-section="0" data-sentence="0" data-group="0-0">If I haven't updated in a few days, please push me!</span></p>
<p>(No one really pushed me because no one knew about the page at the time. So I had a long period of time in the middle of the two-month preparation cycle when I didn't study anything. You can see it in my  record.)

<h3>Words</h3>
Review the word book I have memorized before.

	</ul>
	<p>Then I ran through them two days before the test.</p>
	<p>When I was preparing for the TOEFL exam, I used the New Oriental word book and APP to memorize the words, and I recited the words three or four times. In fact, when I looked at the words I had memorized before the test, I still didn't know more than a third of them.

	<h4>Summary of Experience</h4>
	<p>I have a good reading foundation, and I got more than 27 points in the model test when I just finished the New Oriental course. So reading is not the focus of my exam preparation. In the early stage of preparing for the exam, I usually spare time to do a reading every day (refer to the difficulty level above). I think some topics, such as humanities and history, are difficult for science students to understand, but after doing more questions, my speed will naturally become faster. One or two weeks before the exam, I may occasionally do a new set of TPO, and the accuracy rate is relatively high.

</p>
	<h3>Listening</h3><p>Record the exercises and summarize the results.
	</p><p>As for listening, I prefer to do questions directly or listen extensively rather than attentively, because I think attentively listening takes too much time, and listening to repeated texts is difficult to practice the ability of listening to unfamiliar materials. Of course, I do not deny that careful listening is a necessary way to improve the quality of listening level. If you want to pick out some phonetic phenomena, it is obviously not enough to listen to them once or twice, but you can listen carefully to certain words.

	<h4>Summary of Experience</h4>
	<p>My listening foundation is very poor, listening has always been the most difficult part of my preparation. In my practice record, you can see that my score has been hovering in the range of 19-23 for a long time, and I could not achieve more than 25 points steadily until one week before the exam. But practice makes perfect, and I did almost all of the TPOs and found some feeling on my own. These feelings and experiences can not be said in a few words, simple point such as often said signal words, examples, etc. By the time I got to the actual exam, I even noticed that a listening passage actually had one question for each example. It can be said that mastering these skills will make it easier to take the test, but you need to practice enough. If you have any problems in doing exercises or come to the bottleneck period of raising marks, please feel free to come and communicate with me. I have done a lot of questions and suffered a lot naturally, so I may understand your feelings.

</p><p>If you are not good at listening, practice hard. Remember this: It is normal to listen for four or five hours a day while studying for the TOEFL, and the effort will pay off. You have to keep believing in yourself, even if you may not see results in the short term. If you have a poor listening foundation and only listen for an hour a day, don't complain that it doesn't work.</p>
	<p>It is very important to immerse yourself in English environment. For example, you can watch an American TV series every day. If you don't know what to watch, you can come to talk to me. Or as some excellent students said, we can change Bilibili website to YouTube to satisfy our daily entertainment. However, YouTube is based on subscription system, which may not always push the content you are interested in like domestic video software.

</p>
	<h3>Speaking</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.hugejiaoyu.com/2021/03/22/2019sptopics/">Independent questions in actual tests in 2019</a> The topics for the whole year of 2019 cover a wide range and are very representative. Do you agree or disagree with a point of view? It's fair to say that if you make all of this up, all the problems you'll see will look familiar.

</p>
  <p>Record and score in New Oriental. My oral English teacher told me that if you can score above 3.2 in the first pass, your score in the practical test will probably reach 21-22.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, due to the update of New Oriental App, the audio report recorded by the old version can no longer be listened to. It's like a precious memory of a toddler is lost in the process of growing up.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>USTC 【English Corner】
	    Subject: clothes. I feel that the English corner at school is like an English communication class, which is a bit boring and not suitable for my social phobia. However, the foreign teachers exchange offered by the Eastern Library looks very attractive. I will attend it later.

<h4>Summary of Experience</h4>
<p>Practice makes perfect. If you practice enough you'll get better. However, there may be some overfitting: as you practice more TPO questions, your test-taking skills will improve significantly, but your actual communication skills may decrease rather than increase. Of course, it's just personal experience.
</p>
<p>Let me offer some ideas for my own exercises.
</p>
<p>As for independent speaking, you need a lot of practice. My suggestion is to open a <a href="2012-2019ind.pdf">question bank</a> on the computer and prepare the APP on the phone to record and score. Read the questions aloud and then begin to answer the questions immediately. Yes, no preparation time is required, and the ability to talk and think is a huge boost in the early stages. That way you can probably answer ten questions in less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>Template: From my perspective, I would definitely agree or disagree with the statement that...To be more specific...This is because...For example...By contrast...</p>
<p>As long as you develop a pattern and practice, you'll be able to figure out what you're going to say when you say these connectives. And if you practice enough, the following content will be said many times, opening the mouth to come. In independent speaking, clarity and fluency are more important than content. In this case, you may find that the 15 seconds given to prepare for the test is unnecessary and may even make you feel bored and distracted. But if you say it often enough, you won't feel like 15 seconds isn't enough time to come up with an example, because you don't need that time.</p>
<p>In the practical test, there are also some tips for answering independent spoken English. For example, you can control the time to let others speak first, so that you can not only know the topic in advance, but also borrow other people's points of view. It's not a technique to recommend, but you can use it.</p>
<p>About comprehensive oral English, listening and reading is very important. Both chapters have strong routines, so if you practice enough, you can read them in seconds. Listening requires you to memorize enough and clear information, which tests your hand speed. It's important to write down a lot of detail, but that doesn't mean you write down every sentence, because there's a lot of repetition, and you can't say two or three minutes of audio in one minute. In the 60 second presentation you will develop a set pattern for each problem, you can refer to the web page I put above <a href="https://www.toeflresources.com/sample-toefl-essays/" >there</a> or feel free to read some tutorials.</p>
<p>In fact, I did not answer the comprehensive oral English well in the actual test. There were some stuttering situations, and some details of the last two questions were not finished. It is also important to control the time and speed of speaking. I say this to show that there is no need to be anxious. The occasional flaw, such as not finishing an answer, may not matter much. But if you're after high marks, do them perfectly, at least to your satisfaction.</p>
	<h3>Writing</h3>
	<p>I plan to sort out some sample essays in the early stage. Most of them are from Teacher Li of New Oriental, I would like to express my thanks to him for his patient guidance and conclusion  </p>

  </ul><h4>Summary of Experience</h4>
<p>I don't have much experience with writing. First of all, I think the most important content in the front: when you answer the comprehensive writing, you should read quickly and write down as much information as possible in the listening section. In fact, the information of each idea in the comprehensive writing is not very large, maybe two or three sentences. To answer for independent writing, you need to work on your typing speed, say 500 words in 20 minutes. But in fact, you don't need to write too much on the actual exam. Maybe 370 to 450 is enough to get a high score. Make sure you have five minutes left to check for grammar and spelling errors.</p>
	  <p>I didn't start to review writing systematically until one week before the exam. At that time, I looked at the previous writing handouts and some online courses. Among them, Vince's independent writing at Bilibili benefited me a lot. The amount of practice in that week was relatively large, which was also all the training for me to prepare for the exam writing this time. On average, I wrote about one paper a day, and I wrote several comprehensive writing and independent writing. Every time I finish writing, I will use Youdao Dictionary to correct, until the day before the test, there will be a lot of grammar mistakes. At that time, the revised score was about 24-28, but I didn't care.</p>
		<p>One week before the exam, I compiled a <a href="wmodel.pdf">template</a> based on various materials for reference.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk too much about writing, because I didn't think much of it when I studied for the test, and I thought I could get a 22-23 with no preparation, and that should be enough. But since I got an unexpectedly high score, if you're curious about how to prepare for writing, feel free to talk to me and I can give you some advice that may not be so helpful.</p>
<p></p>
 <h3>Model Test Score Report</h3>
<p>When I was sorting out the materials, I found these reports, but they were all materials at the beginning of my study. After the last mock examination, my exam was cancelled, and I did not learn English for about half a year. The reference is of little significance.
